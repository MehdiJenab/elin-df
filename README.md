**Elin DF** is a Python implementation of the *Elin Distribution Function* framework for studying nonlinear electrostatic structures such as electron and ion holes and solitons in plasma systems.

This package provides tools to initialize parameters, compute self-consistent distribution functions, and analyze soliton structures using configuration files and numerical routines derived from the original Fortran and MATLAB implementations.

## 🔬 Scientific Context

This repository accompanies an upcoming scientific publication by **Mehdi Jenab**, where the theoretical and computational aspects of the Elin distribution framework are presented in detail.  
The repository serves as a reference implementation and a foundation for future computational studies of kinetic plasma phenomena.
